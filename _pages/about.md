I am currently a **senior undergraduate student** at School of Data Science & Engineering, **South China Normal University** [(SCNU)](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of **Prof.** [Jin-Hua Zhao](http://ds.scnu.edu.cn/a/20221109/116.html). My major is **Data Science and Big Data Technology** (Rank 1/30) .

My research interest lies in the intersection of **complex network**, **computational neuroscience** and **machine learning**.

# üë®‚Äçüî¨ Research experience

My research focuses on **percolation phenomena in complex networks**, **combinatorial optimization problems in graph theory**, and **geometric probability problems**.

I participate in two research projects:

1. The impact of randomly reinforced nodes on the robustness of interdependent networks
2. An extended study of the Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem

In both projects, my work involves **theoretical derivations**, **numerical computations**, and **programming simulations**.
